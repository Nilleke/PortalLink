**Fork for LetsBuild.net**  
This is a fork of the PortalLink plugin for the LetsBuild server network. It has been updated to 1.13.2 and has been confirmed to work for versions between *1.8.0* and *1.13.2*. This fork was created to fix an issue that prevented the plugin from working on 1.8 and later.  
> Note: There are currently no plans for a 1.14.x update. md5 removed the TravelAgent from the Bukkit API without warning/deprecation and there is no replacement. As this is a core component of the plugin, it would be hard to update this plugin at this time. Hopefully md5 changes his mind or someone else adds it to the papermc.io fork.

# Portallink
This Bukkit plugin aims to change the behaviour of nether portals so that if you are in any
world other than 0 and 1 (the main world and its nether) and use a nether portal, you go to
the nether/normal world for that world rather than for the main world.
